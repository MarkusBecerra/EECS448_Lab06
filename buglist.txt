Markus Becerra - Buglist

1. Whenever enqueue is called, the new node is placed at the front of the queue instead of the back. This makes the structure seem more like a Stack than a Queue.
2. The destructor for the queue class doesnt seem to delete objects on the heap properly, as when valgrind is called, there are memory leaks.
3. Nodes in the queue can take chars, but I assume when an char is passed in, it's converted to it's int ASCII value.
